## Website name- Yum Recipe

### Website live Link- https://yumrecipe-m.vercel.app/

### Technologies:

- This project is made by React.js, Tailwind CSS.

### Website features:

- Here I use functional components to the sections.
- I utilize React hooks for state management. Like in the navbar I manage the navs which will display or not in different devices through a state(showNav, setShowNav). I also make Recipe details page , filtered recipe by country , search recipe by name.
- The application is responsive as well.
- Here, I used MealDB (https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) for json data.
